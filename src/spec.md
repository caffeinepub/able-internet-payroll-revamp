# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create an alternative design version (Version 3) for Able Payroll with a completely different visual aesthetic while preserving all existing content.

**Planned changes:**
- Design a new visual aesthetic that is distinctly different from the current purple-blue gradients and glassmorphism style
- Apply the new design system consistently across all existing sections (Hero, FeaturesOverview, MobileAccessSection, ComplianceSection, Footer)
- Maintain all existing payroll content and messaging from Version 2
- Ensure the new design maintains professional credibility appropriate for a financial/payroll service platform

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a completely redesigned Able Payroll landing page with a fresh visual aesthetic while all content, features, and functionality remain identical to the previous version.
