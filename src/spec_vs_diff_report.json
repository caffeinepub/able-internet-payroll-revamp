  "summary": "The implementation successfully creates an alternative design version (Version 3) with a completely different visual aesthetic. The new design adopts a clean corporate style with deep navy blue and vibrant orange colors, sharp geometric elements, and minimal borders—distinctly different from Version 2's purple-blue gradients and glassmorphism. All existing payroll content sections are preserved with identical messaging across Hero, FeaturesOverview, MobileAccessSection, ComplianceSection, and Footer components. The design maintains professional credibility appropriate for financial services with consistent application of the new design system.",
